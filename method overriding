Method Overriding :-

Overriding is the ability of a class to change the implementation of a method provided by one of its ancestors. 
Overriding is a very important part of OOP since it is the feature that makes inheritance exploit its full power. 
In Python method overriding occurs simply defining in the child class a method with the same name of a method in the parent class. 
When you define a method in the object you make this latter able to satisfy that method call, so the implementations of its ancestors do not come in play.




class Parent:        # define parent class
   def myMethod(self):
      print 'Calling parent method'

class Child(Parent): # define child class
   def myMethod(self):
      print 'Calling child method'

c = Child()          # instance of child
c.myMethod()         # child calls overridden method


Output :
   Calling child method
